# This_or_That
Project 1 for GA's SEI 

## Project Description

The app will capture Zomato's API to retrieve restaurants by filtering through location. Two restaurants will be listed each time to help the user narrow down where they will decide to eat. They will pick either this or that. The previous decicison will remain until the next this or that knocks it out of the running. There will be a limited number of retievals so the user gets it's final decision quickly.
